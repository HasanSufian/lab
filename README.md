This project brings together my frontend experiments. It contains animation tests, WebGL experiments, API tests and much more.

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## Development

1. Create a folder in the `src` folder with an `index.js` file and an `index.html` file at its root. The name of this folder determines the slug of the page.

2. Add to the html file a tag `<title>MY TITLE</title>` which will become the name of the experiment on the home page.

3. Add a meta `<meta name="category" content="MY CATEGORY">` to determine the category of the experiment on the home page.

4. Import style files into the `index.js` file.

5. Launch the project with `npm run start`.
